## Car Price Prediction Web Application           

### Introduction           

This project aims to predict the selling price of cars using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset containing various features such as car name, year, selling price, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and owner count, the application provides accurate estimates to both sellers and buyers in the used car market.

### Dataset Overview           

The dataset comprises the following columns:

- Car_Name: Name of the car
- Year: Year of manufacturing
- Selling_Price: Selling price of the car
- Present_Price: Current price of the car
- Kms_Driven: Kilometers driven by the car
- Fuel_Type: Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)
- Seller_Type: Type of seller (Dealer, Individual)
- Transmission: Type of transmission (Manual, Automatic)
- Owner: Number of previous owners

### Data Preprocessing           

- Imported necessary libraries for data analysis (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of features and target variable
- Performed feature engineering to create new features such as 'no_of_years'

### Exploratory Data Analysis           

- Examined the statistical summary of numerical features
- Visualized the relationships between different features using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Analyzed the correlation between features using a heatmap

### Feature Engineering           

- Created new features such as 'no_of_years' to capture the age of the car
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding for model compatibility

### Model Building           

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Utilized RandomForestRegressor for the prediction task
- Employed RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- Fit the model to the training data and made predictions on the test data

### Evaluation            

- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE)
- Visualized feature importance to understand the significant predictors

### Conclusion           

The RandomForestRegressor model demonstrates promising results in predicting the selling price of used cars. Further optimizations and fine-tuning could enhance the model's accuracy and robustness.

### Future Improvements           

- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms for comparison
- Incorporate more features or external datasets to improve prediction accuracy
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions
